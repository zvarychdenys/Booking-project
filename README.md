# My dashboard using Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/denys.zvarych/viz/booking_dashboard/Dashboard2?publish=yes)

1. `Booking.py` - script for booking.com which parses hotels from the `european_cities.txt` and collects them into csv files in the `data_csv` folder for further analysis

2. `Hotel_analysis.ipynb` - I analyzed and visualized more than 10 graphs on the topics that interest me most, such as: The best and worst cities according to average estimates, which city has the biggest discounts, which category of hotels are the most popular and where discounts are most common and much more!
